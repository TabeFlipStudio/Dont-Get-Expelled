## Game Manual file
Welcome! This manual should be an in-game feature but the **programmers** are lazy sleaze bags so here comes a markdown file!

## Installation
Here is an instruction on how
to install the game step-by-step.

### Install Python (if not already installed)
Go to Python's website (https://www.python.org), then **Downloads** section and
click the *Download* button. Save the installation file and open it. Follow instructions
of the Python installer. **Make sure that the *add Python to Path* box is checked, otherwise you will have to do several more things you don't want to do** (Forgot to do it anyway? See the end of this section for instructions on how to fix it).

## Main objective
Your main task in this game is to survive several days in Batory without ending up expelled for crimes against humanity (in demo version there is only one day). There will be many opportunities to do something bad: doing so will make you closer to being expelled!

# Some mechanics :wrench:
## Controls
- :video_game: In game:
	-   **Arrow Keys** – Move

	-   **SHIFT**– Sprint

	-   **I** – Toggle Inventory

	-   **E** – Interact (Enter a dialogue with an NPC or pick up an item)

	-   **ESC** – Toggle Saving Menu and exit from any other window

	-   **M** – Minimap

- :phone:  In dialogue with NPC:
	-   **Arrow Keys (up and down)** – Change Selection

	-   **ENTER** – Select Answer

## The Fault Counter :exclamation:
This is the Fault Counter – it shows how many bad things you can commit before saying goodbye to the school. Every time you commit a fault, this counter will decrease (you will be notified by an unpleasant sound). If it reaches zero – Bye! Bye!

![the corner img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TabeFlipStudio/Dont-Get-Expelled/main/gamefiles/images/manual_images/faults.png)

Some faults are significant enough to subtract **more than one point** from this counter, so can put the skids under you faster. The most serious crimes can even get you expelled instantly! But do not worry – helping others selflessly is a valued quality in this school! There are some deeds you can commit that can **increase** the Fault Counter, that is to avert you from expulsion.

## Quests  :question:
Quests in this game are divided into 2 types:
- **main quests** you need to complete in order to win the level
-  **side quests** – not obligatory but they may help you one way or another.

Both types of quests are displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen:

## NPCs :bust_in_silhouette:
There are many Non-Person Characters in the game; their main (and only) task is
to talk to you. Some NPCs you can talk to instantly, any-time; another ones will only
want to talk after you complete certain actions; finally, there are freaks who will remain silent no matter what you do.
So don't get mad if you spam E near an NPC and nothing happens - it's not a bug, it's a feature :wink:

## Save system :heavy_check_mark:
This game has a save system - any time you want, you can save the game (press ESC and click the 'Save' button), close it,
get some rest (get a life you nerd!) and then load it from main menu and continue
playing from the very point you have finished. If you don't have a game saved,
you cannot load it, so please don't spam the 'Load Game' button like a maniac.

Keep in mind that there is no auto-save on quit; if you forget to save and close the game, losing all progress,
this is entirely your problem.

Due to technical issues, saving game in the very top-left corner of the screen
will make you unable to load it. So don't do it. Or do. But never try.

## Inventory  :hand:
![inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TabeFlipStudio/Dont-Get-Expelled/main/gamefiles/images/manual_images/inventory.png)

This is your inventory – should you not know, you store your items here.
The slots are divided into two types:
- **storage slots** (the two rows of eight slots)
-  **drop slot** (the single slot on the bottom).

You can move your items freely between the storage slots by **clicking** on them and **dragging** them to target slot.
> In order to throw an item out of the inventory, put it in the drop slot.
## Minimap  :round_pushpin:
![minimap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TabeFlipStudio/Dont-Get-Expelled/main/gamefiles/images/manual_images/minimap.png)

This is the Minimap. It shows the entire map with all rooms and NPC marked on it. Use it, if you do not know where to go.
