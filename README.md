# Dont-Get-Expelled - The Batory Game (Demo)
Welcome! This manual should be an in-game feature but the **programmers** are lazy sleaze bags so here comes a markdown file!

## Main objective
Your main task in this game is to survive several days in Batory without ending up expelled for crimes against humanity (in demo version there is only one day). There will be many opportunities to do something bad: doing so will make you closer to being expelled!

## The fault corner
This is the Fault Counter – it shows how many bad things you can commit before saying goodbye to the school. Every time you commit a fault, this counter will decrease (you will be notified by an unpleasant sound). If it reaches zero – Bye! Bye!

Some faults are significant enough to subtract **more than one point** from this counter, so can put the skids under you faster. The most serious crimes can even get you expelled instantly! But do not worry – helping others selflessly is a valued quality in this school! There are some deeds you can commit that can **increase** the Fault Counter, that is to avert you from expulsion.

## Quests 
Quests in this game are divided into 2 types: 
- **main quests** you need to complete in order to win the level
-  **side quests** – not obligatory but they may help you one way or another. 

Both types of quests are displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen:

## Inventory
![inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TabeFlipStudio/Dont-Get-Expelled/main/gamefiles/images/manual_images/inventory.png)
This is your inventory – should you not know, you store your items here. 
The slots are divided into two types: 
- **storage slots** (the two rows of eight slots) 
-  **drop slot** (the single slot on the bottom). 

You can move your items freely between the storage slots by **clicking** on them and **dragging** them to target slot. 
> In order to throw an item out of the inventory, put it in the drop slot.
## Minimap
![minimap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TabeFlipStudio/Dont-Get-Expelled/main/gamefiles/images/manual_images/minimap.png)
This is the Minimap. It shows the entire map with all rooms and NPC marked on it. Use it, if you do not know where to go.
